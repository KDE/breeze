## Overview
_Klassy_ (formerly _ClassiK_/_ClassikStyles_) is a highly customizable binary Window Decoration, Application Style and Global Theme plugin for recent versions of the KDE Plasma desktop. Initially taking inspiration from the iconography of KDE 1, the _Klassy_ defaults are an attempt to create a usable and appealing look for the modern Plasma desktop. Install with the instructions below, and then make sure it is enabled in System Settings -> Appearance -> Window Decorations, in System Settings -> Appearance -> Application Style and in System Settings -> Appearance -> Icons.

* Also provides _Oxygen/Breeze_ and _Redmond_ button icons
* Provides both a Window Decoration and an Application Style so that icons in dockable panels and MDI applications consistently match the titlebar icons (make sure to enable both in your Plasma Appearance settings!):

* Configurable button size, shape, translucency, colours and outlining

* Default buttons (_Klassy_ preset) are "Integrated Rounded Rectangles" with translucent outlined accent colours, with a large clickable area. These are designed to complement the "Blue Ocean" design refresh in Plasma 5.23, along with the Plasma 5.23 accent colour feature:

* Alternative "Traffic lights" background colours:

* Ability to inherit system colour-scheme highlight colours for hover and focus, as well as titlebar colour. Auto-enhances contrast in cases where it is poor
* Option to have matching titlebar colour and border colour

* Configurable button spacing (left and right), titlebar margins (sides, top/bottom and option for different maximized), corner radius; all with scaling for HiDPI:

* Transparency/opacity configurable for both active/inactive titlebars/headers; setting to make maximized windows opaque; blur is configurable:

* Configurable thin window outline with optional accent colours:

* Configurable scrollbars:

* Configurable animations

* Ability to load icons from the system icon theme. `window-*-symbolic` icons are recommended for this purpose. If the icons have been designed properly with SVG CSS properties then they will be colourized by default. You can also force the colourization of any symbolic icon by checking the _Force-colourize icons_ window decoration setting.

## System icon theme
To make your Plasma Desktop fully consistent, Klassy auto-generates "Klassy" and "Klassy Dark" system icon themes whenever a window-decoration setting changes. These add consistent titlebar button icons to certain minor context menus in Plasma, and also add consistent GTK application titlebar icons (for Firefox to have consistent titlebar icons on Wayland, it is recommended to set the system GNOME/GTK Application style to Adwaita as Breeze is buggy).
> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulmcauley/classikstyles/paulmcauley/selectable_buttoniconstyles/screenshots/klassy_square_icons.png" alt="Screenshot of Klassy with  icon theme" width="512">

These icons inherit the _Breeze_ icon theme by default, only overriding the titlebar button icons. Another icon theme may be inherited by changing the setting in the Window Decoration settings under the _System Icon Generation..._ button.

## Klassy Settings
Klassy includes a settings application, `klassy-settings`. This shows Window Decoration and Application Style settings in one place.

`klassy-settings` also has command-line options to allow Preset file imports, load Presets and generate system icons. Run `klassy-setttings --help` for details.
